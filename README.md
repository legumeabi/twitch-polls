# Twitch Polling Tool

A Twitch polling tool bot and poll visualization overlay for custom polls.

## How to Use

If you just want to get started with a easy-to-use version you can use the glitch.com project [twitch-polls](https://twitch-polls.glitch.me). You can integrate the tool into your [streaming software directly](#integration-into-obs) and get automatic updates from time to time.

As an alternative you can create an account on glitch.com and "remix" the project. This allows you to customize the look of the tool with the proivded `theme.css` file, and you can also manually update the version number if you want to get the latest version.

## Themeability

You can customize some aspects of the poll design by altering the CSS values in the `theme.css` file.

## Configuration

You can edit the `useIcons` to be false if you prefer not have icons shown for winners and tie-break winners:

```
window.config = {
  useIcons: true, // true or false, default: true
}
```

## Commands

The chat commands to start and edit polls are only available to the broadcaster.

### Starting a Poll

There are different ways to start a poll:

`!poll`: starts a poll with just two options named 1 and 2.

`!poll 3`: starts a poll with three options named 1, 2, 3. (Up to 9 options are supported).

`!poll "what kind of person are you?" "cat person?" "dog person?" "why not both?"`: starts a poll with a title (the first text) and three named options and a title (everything after the first text). These option names will appear next to the option numbers.

`!poll "" "cat person?" "dog person?" "why not both?"`: leaves out the title (which will default to "Poll") and supplies the same three options:

### Changing the Poll Title

`!polltitle "New Poll Title"`

This will change the poll title of the currently active poll to "New Poll Title".

### Stopping a Poll

`!pollstop`

This will stop the currently active poll in its current state and highlights the winning option. If several options are tied they will be highlighted together.

### Resuming a Poll

`!pollresume`

This will resume the currently stopped, but still visible poll.

### Breaking a Tied Poll

`!polltiebreak`

This will pick a random winner out of the tied options in the poll.

### Resetting the Votes

`!pollreset`

This will leave the currently running poll active and visible while resetting all the votes.

### Ending a Poll

`!pollend`

This completely ends the poll and throws away the results. You can't recover the results after.

## How Votes Work

When a poll is active any number that is put into chat counts as a vote by that user. Following rules apply:

- A number is only counted when it is a valid option number
- A number is only counted when the message starts with that number (optionally followed by a space and arbitrary other text).
- A user can change their vote to another number by inputting another valid number
- With inputting 0 the user can withdraw their vote

## Integration into OBS

This guide describes OBS, but it should work almost identical in other streaming software.

Take the URL under which the tool is running. In case you remixed on Glitch, the URL should be something similar to `https://rando-url-soup.glitch.me`. Here's how you integrate it into OBS.

Add a browser source and as the URL you input:

```
https://rando-url-soup.glitch.me?channel=XYZ
```

Substitute `XYZ` with your channel name.

Make sure you adjust the values for width and height to:

```
width: 1920
height: 1080
```

If you don't want the poll to be in the default position (top left) you can append another parameter to the URL to change this. The following URL puts the overlay into the bottom right:

```
https://rando-url-soup.glitch.me?channel=XYZ&position=br
```

Replace the `br` with any corner you like. These are the supported options:

- `tl`: top left (default)
- `tr`: top right
- `br`: bottom right
- `bl`: bottom left

## Creating a New Release

As follows a step-by-step of how our own relase process. It's a combination of GitHub workflows to create a tagged build artefact on a git release branch that can then be imported via a CDN service in the glitch project's basic HTML file.

### GitHub Part

1. Create and push new commit with the following things:

- Make sure the changelog is up-to-date: Everything that was "unreleased" previously should now live under a new version header under appropriate sub headers (features, bugfixes, internal changes).
- Make sure the same version number is updated in the package.json and also run `npm install` once so that it is reflected into the package-lock.json.

2. Trigger the GitHub worflow "Release a new version":

- Pick the `main` branch with the latest commit
- Enter the previously chosen version number and hit "Run workflow"

3. Build a GitHub Release

- Base it on the new version tag (that was created by the workflow)
- Copy the latest changelog Entries into the release notes as-is (check previous releases if unsure)

### Glitch Part

1. Update the version number in the HTML file in the [twitch polls glitch project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/twitch-polls) where the file is imported. For example: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/thelegumeduprix/twitch-polls@2.1.2/release/poll.js
2. Re-Import the GitHub repository into the [twitch polls detailed glitch project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/twitch-polls-detailed).

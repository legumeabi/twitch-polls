/* Theme customization 
 Change colors and other styles for your polls.
 The next block are the actual styles and below that you can find some pointers and instructions for changing them.

:root {
  /* background color for the whole poll box */
  --poll-background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.99);
  /* color for most of the text */
  --poll-text-color: #fff;
  /* fill color for ordinary poll options */
  --option-color: #823597;
  /* fill color for the winning poll option */
  --option-color-win: #1ed581;
  /* fill color for the poll options that are in a tie/draw */
  --option-color-tie: orange;
  /* how round are the corners of the whole poll box */
  --poll-corner-radius: 40px;
  /* how much space is around the poll options */
  --poll-padding: 32px;
  /* text font for most of the text */
  --body-text-font-family: Futura, system-ui, sans-serif;
  /* text size for most of the text */
  --body-text-font-size: 24px;
  /* text font for the poll title */
  --poll-title-font-family: Futura, system-ui, sans-serif;
  /* text size for the poll title */
  --poll-title-font-size: 32px;

/* Glitch Preview
For trying out style changes in Glitch, you can go to "Preview" (below this editor) and
then "Open preview pane". This gives you an (initially empty) preview on the right. 
Add "?debug" at the end of the URL of the preview window. The full URL could 
e.g. look like this: https://typhoon-axiomatic-glove.glitch.me/?debug
This will give you a demo poll, so you can see (most of) the styles in action. 
Whenever you change styles above, the preview will update automatically.
*/

/* How do the style rules work anyway?
The style rules all follow the same format:
 --some-variable: someValue;
"someValue" is the value you can actually change, keeping the variable name and also
the semicolon ';' at the end.
As you might have guessed everything between /* and *â€‹/ is just comments and ignored by the computer.
*/

/* Colors
For picking your own colors you can e.g. use https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp 
You can start with the current color value (paste it into "Enter a Color" there) and
change it - or pick an entirely different color.
You can browse around https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_colors_hsl.asp to learn even more about colors.
*/

/* Size & Border Radius
Font sizes are in pixels (px). Same goes for border radius, which makes the corners of a box
less or more round.
Just experiment with larger or smaller values. Be sure to keep the "px" directly after
the number value without a space, i.e. "50px" instead of "50 px".
*/

/* Font Families
Font families are the way to set the text font.
Have a look at https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-family.php to learn more about possible values.

/*
If you liked playing around with the styles, maybe you want to learn more about CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), 
which is what we just used for styling the polls and what is used to style every web page.
This is a good place to start your deep dive:
